# What is RayerV
RayerV is a program developed for local area network file transfer via Windows and MacOS. The application has both MacOS and Windows release version. Just Intall it and have fun. 

# Attention

1. RayerV still has some bugs but these bugs are rarely occurred.
2. Before using RayerV, make sure your router and your devices allow each other to be found. Take me as an example, my router forbids the local area network communication so during my developing stage, I used my android's hotspot to test. Be aware of the matters above.
